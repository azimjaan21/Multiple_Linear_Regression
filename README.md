**Equation for multiple linear regression**

Y is the dependent variable, X1, X2, … Xn are the independent variables, β0 is the intercept term, β1, β2, … βn are the coefficients for each independent variable and ε is the error term. The coefficients β0, β1, β2, … βn are estimated using the data and a method such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).

**Ordinary Least Squares**
This method minimizes the sum of squared differences between the observed values of the dependent variable and the predicted values given by the equation.

I hope this post served as a good introduction to Multiple Linear Regression. It is a useful tool for understanding the relationship between multiple variables and a dependent variable. It can be applied in many fields, including economics, finance, biology, and others.

However, it is important to keep in mind the assumptions of multiple linear regression, such as linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality, and to carefully interpret the results.
